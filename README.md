# Mini_project1_yun

1. The img folder contains the original images, and the total number is 100. masks folder  		contains all the segmentated masks. 
	The img_kmeans_yun and img_meanshift_yun contains the segmentation results from both algorithms.
	The seg_res_kmeans and seg_res_meanshift contains all the results from segemented images results. 

2. The time and dice coefficient have been saved into four excel files, and median and mean 	value are provided. Scatter plots are also shown in the excel file. 

3. For each algotithm, there are bad_seg and good_seg examples in the folder, and I have 		selected some of the samples inside. 

4. In the ipynb file, I have included enough essential markdowns for each function. Totally 	there are 3 python files. 

5. cal_dice function is calculating the doce coefficient between segmenetated mask and  		original mask.
